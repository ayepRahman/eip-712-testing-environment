## Motive for this project

Bootstrap a simple project that test out the new ETHEREUM EIP712 MetaMask functionality.
Ethereum wallets like MetaMask will soon introduce the EIP712 standard for typed message signing. This standard allows wallets to display data in signing prompts in a structured and readable format. EIP712 is a great step forward for security and usability because users will no longer need to sign off on inscrutable hexadecimal strings, which is a practice which can be confusing and insecure.

## Checklist

- add a form input to change the value of the sign data.
- add additional provider for testing like INFURA and WALLET CONNECT.
